    <h2>Gurararara! If I knew where that treasure was, the seas would look a lot different, brat.

Listen well: the One Piece isn’t some trinket you can just ask directions to. It’s at the end of a voyage that breaks your bones, your ship, and maybe your spirit if you’re weak.

What we *do* know:

- It’s on the last island of the Grand Line, the one they call **Laugh Tale**.  
- To reach it, you need to follow the **Log Pose** all the way through the Grand Line *or* gather the **Road Poneglyphs** that point the way.  
- Only a handful of crews in history ever reached the end. Even Gol D. Roger’s route wasn’t written down like some map for scavengers.

But hear this, boy:  
Even if someone told you the exact spot, you’d die long before you got there without the strength, crew, and will to claim it.

If you’re serious, don’t ask me *where* it is.  
Build a crew, sail into the Grand Line, survive the New World, and carve your own way to Laugh Tale.  

That’s how a real pirate finds the One Piece.</h2>
